    "#  How many double digits?\n",
    "Bob works for Yamazon as a barcode scanning specialist. Every day, armed with his trusty laser, his job is to scan barcodes of packages as they pass in front of him on a conveyor belt.\n",
    "\n",
    "One day, his boss Beff Jezos tells him \"There's been a big mixup with the new barcodes. We forgot to count every bardcode that had a repeating digit. Now we are short boxes but we and dont know how many to order. I need you to hand count every barcode that has a double digit.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Yamazon barcodes are very long. Bob knows there are more labels to count then he has time in his life. Is there a way to keep his sanity and his job?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this Kata, you will write a function that accepts an integer 'ndigit' representing the number of digits in a barcode. The function should return the total number of n-digit integers which contain a 'double digit' (the same digit twice in a row)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Barcodes are numeric only (containing 0 - 9), and will not have leading zeroes (IE, a six digit barcode will start as 100000).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`number_of_duplicate_digits(2) should return 9`\n",
    "\n",
    "`11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99`\n",
    "\n",
    "`number_of_duplicate_digits(3) should return 171:`\n",
    "\n",
